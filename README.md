# pihole-blocklists

A basic list of social media and messaging sites for use with the pi-hole ad-blocking software.

Most of the domains came from: https://www.netify.ai/resources/applications which seems a little out of date.

For more see: https://github.com/crpietschmann/pi-hole-blocklist and https://github.com/gieljnssns/Social-media-Blocklists
